Hello and welcome to my real estate project that has a functionality for people to sell yachts as well.
- Routing is in the App.js file and App.css has some css to remove default values margin and padding and etc.
- Redux is used only for authentication.
- Components folder has several other folders inside which are comprised of 2 files: JSX & CSS.
- Util folder is for utility functions mostly.
- Pages that make the application what it is:
-- Home page, Sign in & Sign up pages, Estate Catalog, Estate Details, Yacht Catalog, Yacht Details
- If you wonder where are the create estate and yacht listing components - Click your name on the right side of the navbar. A modal will pop up below it and you can see the texts navigating you to those pages.
